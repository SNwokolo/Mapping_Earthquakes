# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose and Summary
The purpose of this project is to show the differences between earthquake magnitudes all over the planet for the last seven days and to do this in a visually-appealing manner. In order to complete this, GeoJSON data was obtained from a website, traversed using JavaScript and the D3 and Leaflet libraries were used plot the data on a mapbox map to an API request. The final map illustrates teh activity between the location and frequency of earthquakes and tectonic plates with fault lines being displayed on the map. The earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear as darker and larger circles and a legend was added to provide context for the data.
